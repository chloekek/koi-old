Koi
===

Koi is a programming language and abstraction library
for describing state transformations of systems,
also known as deployments.

When building a library of abstractions,
it is good to start by looking at the operations
that are inherently available—the primitives—and
making sure that these operations can be composed
into higher level abstractions.
Koi is designed with this principle in mind.

This document will guide you through the design of Koi,
the abstractions in the Koi standard library,
and patterns that you may find useful.
